# mapscripts
Python scripts that call GMT and GDAL to make base maps for geoscience research

To see arguments required for any script, from the command line run: "python [scriptname].py -h"

All scripts will return a list of required and optional arguments, along with examples in some cases of how they have been run in the past.

This requires that GDAL and GMT are installed - occasionally seismic unix must also be installed.

The python environment these scripts have been run within in the past is uwresearch, the packages and versions of which are listed in uwresearch.yml.

Cheers!
